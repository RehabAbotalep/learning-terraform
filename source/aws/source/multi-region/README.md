The `alias` allows you to have multiple configurations for different regions or environments within the same Terraform configuration.

```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

```

```
provider "aws" {
  alias  = "ohio"
  region = "us-east-2"
}

```

With this setup, you can use the "aws" provider for resources in the "us-east-1" region, and you can use the "aws.ohio" provider alias for resources in the "us-east-2" region. 

For example, when defining resources, you can specify the provider alias like this:

```
resource "aws_eip" "lb2" {
  provider = aws.ohio
  domain   = "vpc"
}

```

This way, you can have resources in different regions managed by separate provider configurations.

The `profile` is useful when you have multiple AWS accounts or profiles configured on your machine, and you want to use a specific profile for the resources defined within this provider block.

provider "aws" {
  alias   = "ohio"
  region  = "us-east-2"
  profile = "second-account"
}

Remember that you can reference this alias in your resource blocks to specify which provider to use:

```
resource "aws_eip" "lb2" {
  provider = aws.ohio
  domain   = "vpc"
}

```

**NOTE:** Make sure that the named profile "second-account" is properly configured with the necessary AWS credentials using the AWS CLI or other methods outside of Terraform.
